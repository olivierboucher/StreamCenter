# StreamCenter

StreamCenter is a tvOS project that aims at providing various video feeds to the AppleTV.  
  
We were forced into releasing the app because someone ripped the source code and is selling for $0.99. Our intentions always were to release it for free. However, if you wish to support us, you can go ahead using paypal.

###Things you need:
* XCode 7.1+
* Cocoapods 0.39+ (i.e. `sudo gem install cocoapods` or `sudo gem update cocoapods`)
* The XCodeColors plugin [available here](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors). Otherwise the logging system will output color tags

### Installing Dependencies	
Since we're not including the /Pods directory in the git, you must run `pod install` inside the project directory to install dependencies

Make sure you open GamingStreamsTVApp.xcworkspace to include the generated Pods or you will run into compile errors.
